## Introduction
 In this work, we propose a Data-Oriented Domain Adaptation (DODA) framework on sim-to-real domain adaptation for 3D indoor semantic segmentation. Our empirical studies demonstrate two unique challengeds in this setting: the  point pattern gap and the context gap caused by different sensing mechanisms and layout placements across domains. Thus, we propose virtual scan simulation to imitate real-world point cloud patterns and tail-aware cuboid mixing to alleviate the interior context gap with a cuboid-based intermediate domain. The first unsupervised sim-to-real adaptation benchmark on 3D indoor semantic segmentation is also built on 3D-FRONT, ScanNet and S3DIS along with 8 popular UDA methods.

Notice that
- DODA performance relies on the pretrain model (DODA (only VSS)). If you find the self-training performance is unsatisfactory, consider to re-train a better pretrain model.
- Performance on 3D-FRONT $\rightarrow$ S3DIS is quite unstable with high standard variance due to its simplicity and small sample sizes.
